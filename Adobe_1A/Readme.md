# [Adobe_1A: PDF Outline Extractor](https://github.com/Paras-Gupta16/Adobe_Hackathone_2025/tree/e202e3c385248a06acdb7544278788c8af55aec8/Adobe_1A)

Adobe_1A is built to extract outline (aka bookmarks/table of contents) information from PDF documents. It is a complete, robust, effective method of programmatically retrieving and processing the structured hierarchy embedded in your document.

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of Adobe_1A is to automate the extracting of navigational outlines in PDF documents. Many PDF's, particularly larger documents, have a built in outline, which assists the reader to navigate the document, in a method similar to technical manuals, reports, or e-books. Searching for this information manually across many PDF's is painful and inefficient.

The intent of creating this tool is to address the specific issue of document navigation by:
* **Automating Data Extraction:** A programmatic way to pull out the outline data that is useful for batch processes.
* **Offer a way to further process the information:** Once you have joined the outline data in a smooth format, it can be useful for many things:
    * Build custom navigation sites.
    * Build summaries or index in some form based on document structure.
    * Study structure across multiple documents.
    * Populate databases with document meta information.
    * Convert outlines into different formats (Markdown, JSON, XML).

Basically, Adobe_1A is the first part of a larger workflow for

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Maven directory structure:

* `.idea/`: IntelliJ IDEA project files (can be ignored in Git).
* `input/`: Directory intended for placing input PDF files that you want to process.
* `output/`: Directory where the extracted outline data will be stored.
* `PDF_Folder_Round1A/`: Likely another directory for input PDFs, possibly for a specific "round" of processing or a different set of test files.
* `src/`: Source code directory.
    * `main/`: Main application source.
        * `java/`: Java source files.
            * `org/example/`: Package containing the core logic.
                * `PDFOutlineExtractor.java`: The main class responsible for PDF outline extraction.
        * `resources/`: Configuration files or other resources.
    * `test/`: Unit tests for the application.
* `target/`: Directory for compiled classes and build artifacts (generated by Maven).
* `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
* `Adobe_1A.iml`: IntelliJ IDEA module file.
* `dependency-reduced-pom.xml`: A potentially generated POM file with optimized dependencies (often created by Maven plugins like `maven-shade-plugin`).
* `Dockerfile`: Instructions for building a Docker image of the application (for containerization).
* `pom.xml`: Maven Project Object Model file, defining project dependencies, build plugins, and project metadata.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
* Maven 3.x

### Dependencies
This project uses the following key dependencies:

*Apache PDFBox (2.0.29): For parsing PDF documents and extracting outline information.
*Jackson Databind (2.17.1): For serializing Java objects (representing the outline data) into JSON and deserializing JSON into Java objects.
*SLF4J Simple (2.0.13): A simple logging implementation for SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java), used for basic logging output.

### Building the Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Paras-Gupta16/Adobe_Hackathone_2025.git
    cd Adobe_1A
    ```
2.  **Build with Maven:**
    ```
    mvn clean install
    ```
    This command will compile the source code, run tests, and package the application into a JAR file, which will be found in the `target/` directory.

### Running the Application

1.  **Place PDF files:** Put the PDF documents you wish to process into the `input/` or `PDF_Folder_Round1A/` directory.
2.  **Execute the JAR:**
    ```
        java -jar target/Adobe_1A-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar
    ```
    *(Note: The exact command might vary depending on how `PDFOutlineExtractor.java` is set up to handle input/output paths or if it takes command-line arguments.)*

The extracted outline information will be generated in the `output/` directory.

### Docker Usage
If you prefer to run the application in a Docker container:

Build the Docker image:

*docker build -t adobe-1a-extractor .

Run the Docker container:

# You'll need to mount your input/output directories to the container
docker run -v "$(pwd)/input:/app/input" -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" adobe-1a-extractor

(Adjust /path/to/your/input and /path/to/your/output to your local directories.)
