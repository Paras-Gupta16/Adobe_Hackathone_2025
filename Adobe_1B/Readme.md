# [Adobe_1B: PersonaExtractor](https://github.com/Paras-Gupta16/Adobe_Hackathone_2025/tree/c1b898ed6a167d53ace35a6729a2028ecbacea09/Adobe_1B)

Adobe_1B is a Java application that can extract sections from a PDF, rank those sections in terms of relevance to the user and job to be done, and so on. The application uses Apache PDFBox to perform the PDF parsing and Jackson to produce structured JSON output. The creativity of this application is the notion of inferring the user and goal from the initial content of the document, then scoring a document's sections based on contextual relevance to that goal.

## Purpose of the Project

 ## Adobe_1B tackles this with:

1. Persona and Goal Inference: It will try to automatically identify "persona" and "job to be done" by extracting the first two non-empty lines from the first page of the first PDF discovered in a language directory (It assumes that the initial content of key documents (e.g., project briefs, user stories, or introductory documents, etc.) will often set the context).

2. Heuristic Section Extraction: It does not rely only on the internal outline structure of a PDF, to identify headings (H1, H2, H3), instead, it evaluates the visual properties of text (e.g., font size) and heuristically identifies headings based on this to find "sections" around headings, even if they are not identified as part of any outline.

3. Keyword-Based Relevance Ranking: It extracts the keywords from the inferred "job to be done" and then scores each identified section based on how many of these keywords it contains. This creates a "relevance score" or "importance rank" for each section.

4. Structured Output: All of the extracted metadata (documents processed, inferred persona, job to be done, timestamp, etc.) and the ranked sections are outputted into a well-structured JSON file and are thus easy for applications to consume or for further analysis.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Maven directory structure:

* `.idea/`: IntelliJ IDEA project files (can be ignored in Git).
* `input/`: Directory intended for placing input PDF files that you want to process.
* `output/`: Directory where the extracted outline data will be stored.
* `PDF_Folder_Round1A/`: Likely another directory for input PDFs, possibly for a specific "round" of processing or a different set of test files.
* `src/`: Source code directory.
    * `main/`: Main application source.
        * `java/`: Java source files.
            * `org/example/`: Package containing the core logic.
                * `PDFOutlineExtractor.java`: The main class responsible for PDF outline extraction.
        * `resources/`: Configuration files or other resources.
    * `test/`: Unit tests for the application.
* `target/`: Directory for compiled classes and build artifacts (generated by Maven).
* `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
* `Adobe_1A.iml`: IntelliJ IDEA module file.
* `dependency-reduced-pom.xml`: A potentially generated POM file with optimized dependencies (often created by Maven plugins like `maven-shade-plugin`).
* `Dockerfile`: Instructions for building a Docker image of the application (for containerization).
* `pom.xml`: Maven Project Object Model file, defining project dependencies, build plugins, and project metadata.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
* Maven 3.x

### Dependencies
This project uses the following key dependencies:

*Apache PDFBox (2.0.29): For parsing PDF documents and extracting outline information.
*Jackson Databind (2.17.1): For serializing Java objects (representing the outline data) into JSON and deserializing JSON into Java objects.
*SLF4J Simple (2.0.13): A simple logging implementation for SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java), used for basic logging output.

### Building the Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Paras-Gupta16/Adobe_Hackathone_2025.git
    cd Adobe_1B
    ```
2.  **Build with Maven:**
    ```
    mvn clean install
    ```
    This command will compile the source code, run tests, and package the application into a JAR file, which will be found in the `target/` directory.

### Running the Application

1.  **Place PDF files:** Put the PDF documents you wish to process into the `input/` or `PDF_Folder_Round1B/` directory.
2.  **Execute the JAR:**
    ```
        java -jar target/Adobe_1B-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar
    ```
    *(Note: The exact command might vary depending on how `PersonaExtractor.java` is set up to handle input/output paths or if it takes command-line arguments.)*

The extracted outline information will be generated in the `output/` directory.

### Docker Usage
If you prefer to run the application in a Docker container:

Build the Docker image:

*docker build -t adobe-1b-extractor .

Run the Docker container:

# You'll need to mount your input/output directories to the container
docker run -v "$(pwd)/input:/app/input" -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" adobe-1b-extractor

(Adjust /path/to/your/input and /path/to/your/output to your local directories.)
